Java "Space Game" Demo from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXImR8Wm53M series from RealTutsGML with some enhancements

Includes some code enhancements from the nice video series from RealTutsGML (really cool stuff, thanks!). As an example:

- Split functionality in diffent packages
- Using Generics for controllers and created two separate controllers (one for Enemies another for Bullets)
- Used better names for Interfaces (EntityEnemy and EntityFriendly instead of EntityA and EntityB)
- Physics collition methods do the loop and return the object (or null) instead of true or false
- Enhanced Animation class to accept any number of images using ArrayList<BufferedImage> structure.
- Endless scrolling background
- Added colors for health bar depending on how close to deadth we are 
- Added lives counter (starting by 4) that reduces after 


More to come thanks to my 7-year's-old daughter's feedback who loves this game ... :)
